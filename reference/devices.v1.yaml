    Interact with the `'Devices Service'` API to get a list of registered devices, add or remove devices and updating existing records.

    Use this API to leverage __*CloudHome*__'s central repository of devices that will then allow users to manage automation systems at home, at work or on the go.

    Our documentation will provide everything you need to get started right away. Make requests to our endpoints or use the built-in mocks.

    ```json http
    {
      "method": "get",
      "url": "https://cloudhome.io/api/devices/abc/home",
      "headers": {
        "API Key": "123"
      }
    }
    ```

    We also provide code generation to get your project started as soon as you imagine it!

    ```javascript
    var data = null;

    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.withCredentials = true;

    xhr.addEventListener("readystatechange", function () {
      if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {
        console.log(this.responseText);
      }
    });

    xhr.open("GET", "https://cloudhome.io/api/devices/abc/home");
    xhr.setRequestHeader("api key", "123");

    xhr.send(data);
    ```
